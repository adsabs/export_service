We compare the metallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control sample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a galaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) / {M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are found in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a previous indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich galaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some indication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By applying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the variety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The success of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation. This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-metallicity relation. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-phase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling approach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular emission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the model to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our testing we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central metallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the model and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes approximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-spread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved galaxies. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94 star-forming galaxies between (0.08 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.84). We find a negative median metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007}, dex/kpc)/span&amp;gt;, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to be more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant scatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have significantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have significantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent with being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have unreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and increasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential redshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to be significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies relative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to other recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do, however, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a galaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d &amp;lt; 3 kpc)) present a large spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d &amp;gt; 3 kpc) with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the present-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity gradient. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and its gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between star formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of metals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is therefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-metallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar mass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72 galaxies spanning (0.13 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient estimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean mass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients. We quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance between the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central metallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue that this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central metallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of metal enriched gas. &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n<dc:identifier>doi:10.5281/zenodo.581221</dc:identifier>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>2017nova.pres.2388K</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>A 3D View of a Supernova Remnant</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Kohler, Susanna</dc:creator>\n<dc:source>AAS Nova Highlight, 14 Jun 2017, id.2388</dc:source>\n<dc:date>2017-06-01</dc:date>\n<dc:subject>Features, Highlights, interstellar medium, stellar evolution, supernova remnant, supernovae, white dwarfs</dc:subject>\n<dc:relation>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017nova.pres.2388K</dc:relation>\n<dc:description>The outlined regions mark the 57 knots in Tycho selected by the authors for velocity measurements. Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight velocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-of-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho supernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years later, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build the first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of ExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the ejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the surrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is that they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is this because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar medium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can explore this question is with detailed observations of the remnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the X (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the observer). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots. [Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led by Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard SFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho supernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was destabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of expansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly circular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the supernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of the shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams and collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread out around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray observations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the sky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then combined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D hydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These show that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom) ejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the morphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al. 2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots have total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the forward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in their motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The more likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar medium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant without yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final exploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos clumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer edge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy, or if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and collaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to simulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at this time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an important step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions. The authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the future with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new data from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter emission.CitationBrian J.

Photometry is no longer specifically requested on a regular basis (although ongoing observations that do not interfere with other obligations are welcome). Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653, #8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242, 187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\' spectra obtained by Somogyi Péter in 2015 December demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month before an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000 km/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the outflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any resolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a blueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful. Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary to medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration." "Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database (http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to Adrian and Jeno directly at &amp;lt;lucy@astro.columbia.edu&amp;gt;. Finder charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Photometry should be submitted to the AAVSO International Database.

In early 2017, using archival WISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been steadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6 respectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that F01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the mid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a convex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source. Our model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs should start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already reprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption. However, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs could last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2 hours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12 months. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of this transient event. &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>2017MsT..........2A</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Azankpo, Severin</dc:creator>\n<dc:source>Masters thesis, University of Stellenbosch, March 2017, 120 pages</dc:source>\n<dc:date>2017-03-01</dc:date>\n<dc:relation>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MsT..........2A</dc:relation>\n<dc:description>The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint project between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed at establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable network of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing structure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna located in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in telecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana antenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to observe at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a required performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a radio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication antenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is influenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural deformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research investigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing accuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to its structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and thermal loads. &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>2016emo6.rept.....R</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Rotaru, Adrian</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Pteancu, Mircea</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Zaharia, Cristian</dc:creator>\n<dc:source>http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian)</dc:source>\n<dc:date>2016-10-01</dc:date>\n<dc:subject>THE MOON, ECLIPSES, PARTIAL, PENUMBRAL, ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY</dc:subject>\n<dc:relation>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016emo6.rept.....R</dc:relation>\n<dc:description>The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s partial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few various places in Romania (East Europe).

One could oversimplify NMR spectros-copy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure elucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and imaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR spectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and utilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to present an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy applications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses of NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic resonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory. Included here are summaries of projects involving protein structure determination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring fundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the environmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging of a model organism. &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n<dc:identifier>doi:10.1007/978-90-481-2368-1_5</dc:identifier>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>2007AAS...210.2104M</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Mahabal, Ashish A.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for transient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software filters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain criteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged candidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids, known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects based on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans. Some software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge effects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars. During a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect hundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for astrophysical transients beyond our solar system. &lt;P /&gt;Here we describe some statistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the objects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness of this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other synoptic sky surveys. &lt;P /&gt;We also present an outline of the work we have started on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as various classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ scans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual Observatory environment. &lt;P /&gt;The PQ survey is partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>2007RJPh....1...35.</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>Analysis of Thermal Losses in the Flat-Plate Collector of a Thermosyphon Solar Water Heater</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>., S.

Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and orbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs which may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are considered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance (i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include, but are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as weight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and ground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for spacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational spacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational centers with little or no navigational function allocated to the vehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to be directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military significance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft survivability and performance (accuracy). &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>1995anda.book.....N</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Nayfeh, Ali H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Balachandran, Balakumar</dc:creator>\n<dc:source>Wiley series in nonlinear science, New York; Chichester: Wiley, |c1995</dc:source>\n<dc:date>1995-01-01</dc:date>\n<dc:relation>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995anda.book.....N</dc:relation>\n<dc:description>Not Available &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n<record>\n<dc:identifier>1991hep.th....8028G</dc:identifier>\n<dc:title>Applied Conformal Field Theory</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Ginsparg, Paul</dc:creator>\n<dc:source>eprint arXiv:hep-th/9108028</dc:source>\n<dc:date>1988-11-01</dc:date>\n<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>\n<dc:relation>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991hep.th....8028G</dc:relation>\n<dc:description>These lectures consisted of an elementary introduction to conformal field theory, with some applications to statistical mechanical systems, and fewer to string theory.

The system would require powerful transmitters on the earth-side of the moon\'s surface and black box receivers with antennae and microprocessors placed on board spacecraft for autonomous navigation. Spacecraft navigation requires three position and three velocity elements to establish location coordinates. Two beacons could be soft-landed on the lunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would transmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be strong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The black box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way Doppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites such as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric techniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation. &lt;P /&gt;</dc:description>\n</record>\n\n</records>'}

We compare the metallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control sample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a galaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) / {M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are found in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a previous indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich galaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some indication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By applying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the variety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The success of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation. This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-metallicity relation. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-phase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling approach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular emission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the model to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our testing we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central metallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the model and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes approximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-spread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved galaxies. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94 star-forming galaxies between (0.08 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.84). We find a negative median metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007}, dex/kpc)/span&amp;gt;, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to be more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant scatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have significantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have significantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent with being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have unreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and increasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential redshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to be significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies relative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to other recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do, however, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a galaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d &amp;lt; 3 kpc)) present a large spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d &amp;gt; 3 kpc) with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the present-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity gradient. &lt;P /&gt;Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and its gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between star formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of metals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is therefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-metallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar mass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72 galaxies spanning (0.13 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient estimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean mass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients. We quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance between the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central metallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue that this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central metallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of metal enriched gas. &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n<DOI>10.5281/zenodo.581221</DOI>\n</record>\n\n<record type="pressrelease">\n<bibcode>2017nova.pres.2388K</bibcode>\n<title>A 3D View of a Supernova Remnant</title>\n<author>Kohler, Susanna</author>\n<journal>AAS Nova Highlight, 14 Jun 2017, id.2388</journal>\n<pubdate>Jun 2017</pubdate>\n<keywords>\n<keyword>Features</keyword>\n<keyword>Highlights</keyword>\n<keyword>interstellar medium</keyword>\n<keyword>stellar evolution</keyword>\n<keyword>supernova remnant</keyword>\n<keyword>supernovae</keyword>\n<keyword>white dwarfs</keyword>\n</keywords>\n<link type="abstract">\n<name>abstract</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017nova.pres.2388K/abstract</url>\n</link>\n<link type="coreads">\n<name>Co-Reads</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017nova.pres.2388K/coreads</url>\n</link>\n<link type="PUB_HTML">\n<name>Publisher Article</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017nova.pres.2388K/PUB_HTML</url>\n</link>\n<link type="Chandra">\n<name>Chandra X-Ray Observatory</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017nova.pres.2388K/Chandra</url>\n<count>1</count>\n</link>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017nova.pres.2388K</url>\n<abstract>The outlined regions mark the 57 knots in Tycho selected by the authors for velocity measurements. Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight velocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-of-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho supernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years later, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build the first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of ExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the ejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the surrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is that they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is this because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar medium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can explore this question is with detailed observations of the remnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the X (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the observer). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots. [Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led by Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard SFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho supernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was destabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of expansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly circular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the supernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of the shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams and collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread out around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray observations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the sky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then combined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D hydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These show that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom) ejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the morphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al. 2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots have total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the forward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in their motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The more likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar medium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant without yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final exploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos clumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer edge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy, or if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and collaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to simulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at this time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an important step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions. The authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the future with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new data from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter emission.CitationBrian J.

Photometry is no longer specifically requested on a regular basis (although ongoing observations that do not interfere with other obligations are welcome). Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653, #8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242, 187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\' spectra obtained by Somogyi Péter in 2015 December demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month before an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000 km/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the outflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any resolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a blueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful. Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary to medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration." "Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database (http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to Adrian and Jeno directly at &amp;lt;lucy@astro.columbia.edu&amp;gt;. Finder charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Photometry should be submitted to the AAVSO International Database.

In early 2017, using archival WISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been steadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6 respectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that F01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the mid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a convex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source. Our model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs should start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already reprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption. However, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs could last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2 hours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12 months. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of this transient event. &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n<record type="mastersthesis">\n<bibcode>2017MsT..........2A</bibcode>\n<title>Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope</title>\n<author>Azankpo, Severin</author>\n<affiliation>AA(University of Stellenbosch)</affiliation>\n<journal>Masters thesis, University of Stellenbosch, March 2017, 120 pages</journal>\n<pubdate>Mar 2017</pubdate>\n<page>2</page>\n<link type="abstract">\n<name>abstract</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017MsT..........2A/abstract</url>\n</link>\n<link type="PUB_HTML">\n<name>Publisher Article</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017MsT..........2A/PUB_HTML</url>\n</link>\n<link type="AUTHOR_PDF" access="open">\n<name>Author PDF</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017MsT..........2A/AUTHOR_PDF</url>\n</link>\n<link type="PUB_PDF">\n<name>Publisher PDF</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017MsT..........2A/PUB_PDF</url>\n</link>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MsT..........2A</url>\n<abstract>The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint project between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed at establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable network of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing structure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna located in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in telecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana antenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to observe at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a required performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a radio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication antenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is influenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural deformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research investigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing accuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to its structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and thermal loads. &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n<record type="techreport">\n<bibcode>2016emo6.rept.....R</bibcode>\n<title>The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016</title>\n<author>Rotaru, Adrian</author>\n<author>Pteancu, Mircea</author>\n<author>Zaharia, Cristian</author>\n<affiliation>AA(Bragadiru, Romania), AB(Private Astronomical Observatory, Arad, Romania), AC(Private Astronomical Observatory, Ploiesti, Romania)</affiliation>\n<journal>http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian)</journal>\n<pubdate>Oct 2016</pubdate>\n<keywords>\n<keyword>THE MOON</keyword>\n<keyword>ECLIPSES</keyword>\n<keyword>PARTIAL</keyword>\n<keyword>PENUMBRAL</keyword>\n<keyword>ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY</keyword>\n</keywords>\n<link type="abstract">\n<name>abstract</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2016emo6.rept.....R/abstract</url>\n</link>\n<link type="coreads">\n<name>Co-Reads</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2016emo6.rept.....R/coreads</url>\n</link>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016emo6.rept.....R</url>\n<abstract>The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s partial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few various places in Romania (East Europe).

One could oversimplify NMR spectros-copy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure elucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and imaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR spectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and utilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to present an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy applications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses of NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic resonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory. Included here are summaries of projects involving protein structure determination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring fundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the environmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging of a model organism. &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n<DOI>10.1007/978-90-481-2368-1_5</DOI>\n</record>\n\n<record type="abstract">\n<bibcode>2007AAS...210.2104M</bibcode>\n<title>Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey</title>\n<author>Mahabal, Ashish A.</author>\n<author>Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for transient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software filters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain criteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged candidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids, known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects based on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans. Some software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge effects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars. During a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect hundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for astrophysical transients beyond our solar system. &lt;P /&gt;Here we describe some statistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the objects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness of this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other synoptic sky surveys. &lt;P /&gt;We also present an outline of the work we have started on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as various classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ scans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual Observatory environment. &lt;P /&gt;The PQ survey is partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n<record article="true" type="article">\n<bibcode>2007RJPh....1...35.</bibcode>\n<title>Analysis of Thermal Losses in the Flat-Plate Collector of a Thermosyphon Solar Water Heater</title>\n<author>., S.

Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and orbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs which may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are considered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance (i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include, but are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as weight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and ground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for spacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational spacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational centers with little or no navigational function allocated to the vehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to be directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military significance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft survivability and performance (accuracy). &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n<record type="book">\n<bibcode>1995anda.book.....N</bibcode>\n<title>Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods</title>\n<author>Nayfeh, Ali H.</author>\n<author>Balachandran, Balakumar</author>\n<journal>Wiley series in nonlinear science, New York; Chichester: Wiley, |c1995</journal>\n<pubdate>Jan 1995</pubdate>\n<link type="abstract">\n<name>abstract</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1995anda.book.....N/abstract</url>\n</link>\n<link type="coreads">\n<name>Co-Reads</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1995anda.book.....N/coreads</url>\n</link>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995anda.book.....N</url>\n<abstract>Not Available &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n<record article="true" type="eprint">\n<bibcode>1991hep.th....8028G</bibcode>\n<title>Applied Conformal Field Theory</title>\n<author>Ginsparg, Paul</author>\n<journal>eprint arXiv:hep-th/9108028</journal>\n<pubdate>Nov 1988</pubdate>\n<keywords>\n<keyword>High Energy Physics - Theory</keyword>\n</keywords>\n<link type="abstract">\n<name>abstract</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1991hep.th....8028G/abstract</url>\n</link>\n<link type="coreads">\n<name>Co-Reads</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1991hep.th....8028G/coreads</url>\n</link>\n<link type="EPRINT_HTML">\n<name>arXiv Article</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1991hep.th....8028G/EPRINT_HTML</url>\n</link>\n<link type="EPRINT_PDF" access="open">\n<name>arXiv PDF</name>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1991hep.th....8028G/EPRINT_PDF</url>\n</link>\n<url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991hep.th....8028G</url>\n<abstract>These lectures consisted of an elementary introduction to conformal field theory, with some applications to statistical mechanical systems, and fewer to string theory.

The system would require powerful transmitters on the earth-side of the moon\'s surface and black box receivers with antennae and microprocessors placed on board spacecraft for autonomous navigation. Spacecraft navigation requires three position and three velocity elements to establish location coordinates. Two beacons could be soft-landed on the lunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would transmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be strong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The black box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way Doppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites such as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric techniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation. &lt;P /&gt;</abstract>\n</record>\n\n</records>'}
