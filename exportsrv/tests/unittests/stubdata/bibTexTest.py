Spectroscopy on a cadence of a\n        week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow.\n        Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: ``Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno\n        Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic\n        monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon\n        (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength\n        observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel \\#8653,\n        \\#8832, \\#8957; \\#10281). This system is a perfect place in\n        which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and\n        disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-\n        resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical\n        brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity\n        absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also\n        appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n        187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric\n        quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test\n        the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-\n        spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel\n        \\#10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of\n        this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For\n        example, \'amateur\' spectra obtained by Somogyi P{\\\'e}ter in 2015\n        December demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very\n        low only a month before an optical outburst peak prompted\n        absorption troughs up to 3000 km/s, which constrains very well\n        the timing of the changes to the outflow to a degree that would\n        not have been otherwise possible. Any resolution can be useful.\n        A wavelength range that can accommodate a blueshift of at least\n        140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha\n        at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal,\n        though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\n        Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be\n        supplementary to medium-cadence photometry being collected by\n        the ANS collaboration.\'\' \'\'Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the\n        ARAS database\n        (http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras\\_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or\n        sent to Adrian and Jeno directly at\n        $\\lt$lucy@astro.columbia.edu$\\gt$.
