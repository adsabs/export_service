The lens antenna is\n        made of an artificial material of metal particle. Comparing with\n        our previous study, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented\n        to the lens in this study to obtain a wave matching on the air-\n        lens interface. The improved lens is in a disk shape of 50 mm\n        diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens is applied in a free-\n        space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch antenna\n        resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\n        used to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a\n        sawdust sample. The experimental results show that the multiple-\n        reflection in the free-space method becomes small, because the\n        reflection on air-lens interface has been reduced. The proposed\n        AR lens antenna is flat and very small in the size.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a\n        week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow.\n        Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: \'\'Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno\n        Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic\n        monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon\n        (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength\n        observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel \\#8653,\n        \\#8832, \\#8957; \\#10281). This system is a perfect place in\n        which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and\n        disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-\n        resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical\n        brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity\n        absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also\n        appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n        187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric\n        quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test\n        the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-\n        spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel\n        \\#10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of\n        this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For\n        example, \'amateur\' spectra obtained by Somogyi\n        P\\textbackslashu00c3\\textbackslashu00a9ter in 2015 December\n        demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a\n        month before an optical outburst peak prompted absorption\n        troughs up to 3000 km/s, which constrains very well the timing\n        of the changes to the outflow to a degree that would not have\n        been otherwise possible. Any resolution can be useful. A\n        wavelength range that can accommodate a blueshift of at least\n        140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha\n        at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal,\n        though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\n        Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be\n        supplementary to medium-cadence photometry being collected by\n        the ANS collaboration.\'\' \'\'Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the\n        ARAS database\n        (http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras\\_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or\n        sent to Adrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.\n        Finder charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO\n        Variable Star Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp).

As four photometric\n        bandpasses are utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well\n        suited to search for transient and highly variable objects.\n        Using a series of software filters i.e. programs to\n        select/deselect objects based on certain criteria we shorten the\n        list of candidates from the initially flagged candidate\n        transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\n        known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued\n        objects based on their motion within a scan as well as between\n        successive scans. Some software filters also deal with\n        instrumental artifacts, edge effects, and use clustering of\n        spurious detections around bright stars. During a typical night\n        when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect hundreds of\n        asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\n        astrophysical transients beyond our solar system.
