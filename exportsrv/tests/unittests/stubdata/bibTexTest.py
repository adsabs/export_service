Spectroscopy on a cadence of a\n        week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow.\n        Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: ``Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno\n        Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic\n        monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon\n        (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength\n        observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel \\#8653,\n        \\#8832, \\#8957; \\#10281). This system is a perfect place in\n        which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and\n        disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-\n        resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical\n        brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity\n        absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also\n        appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n        187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric\n        quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test\n        the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-\n        spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel\n        \\#10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of\n        this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For\n        example, \'amateur\' spectra obtained by Somogyi P{\\\'e}ter in 2015\n        December demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very\n        low only a month before an optical outburst peak prompted\n        absorption troughs up to 3000 km/s, which constrains very well\n        the timing of the changes to the outflow to a degree that would\n        not have been otherwise possible. Any resolution can be useful.\n        A wavelength range that can accommodate a blueshift of at least\n        140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha\n        at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal,\n        though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\n        Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be\n        supplementary to medium-cadence photometry being collected by\n        the ANS collaboration.\'\' \'\'Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the\n        ARAS database\n        (http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras\\_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or\n        sent to Adrian and Jeno directly at\n        $\\lt$lucy@astro.columbia.edu$\\gt$.

Under\n        modern conditions, open bodies of water cannot exist on Mars.\n        And water on the planet is contained either in the soil layer as\n        permafrost, or in the form of open ice and snow; a very small\n        amount of water is present in gaseous form in the atmosphere.\n        The large reservoirs of water ice on Mars are the polar caps.\n        Studies of Mars by spacecraft have shown that there is a huge\n        amount of ice, and possibly liquid water, under the surface\n        layer at a shallow depth. Analysis of the collected data allowed\n        us to come to the conclusion that liquid water existed in\n        significant quantities on the surface of Mars several billion\n        years ago. That is, in the past, Mars had a full-fledged\n        hydrosphere and a rather powerful atmosphere with a pressure\n        near the surface of more than 0.4 bar. Later, the planet\'s\n        climate changed. It lost much of its atmosphere and water,\n        turning into a cold world. On the surface of Mars, there are\n        numerous winding valleys with a long length, reminiscent of the\n        dried-up channels of terrestrial rivers. A significant portion\n        of the water that once flowed along currently dry riverbeds must\n        now be under the surface of the planet. It is also possible that\n        some channels are the result of the action of not liquid water,\n        but a mixture of mud, ice and steam that flow only episodically.\n        It is possible that the meandering valleys formed moving masses\n        of glaciers. There is every reason to believe that there is\n        still a lot of water on Mars, and it still exists in the form of\n        permafrost. A perspective image of the Echus Chasma region\n        suggests that liquid water was present on this part of the\n        Martian surface up to a billion years ago. Later, the planet\n        cooled down, the lakes froze, and glaciers formed, which \'cut\'\n        the Kasei Valles with their streams.}",\n       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024wsp..conf...20V},\n      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n\n@INCOLLECTION{2024asal.book..204V,\n       author = {{Vidmachenko}, A.},\n        title = "{New generation telescopes for the astronomy of the future.}",\n     keywords = {new astronomical instruments, Telescopes, telescope construction, astronomical research},\n    booktitle = {In book: Astronomical almanac},\n         year = 2024,\n    publisher = {Kyiv},\n        pages = {204-209},\n     abstract = "{In the next few years, several new astronomical instruments are planned\n        to be launched on Earth and in space. Each of these devices is\n        very expensive! But many countries allocate large amounts of\n        money for this, and plan to receive more and more recent data\n        about the surrounding universe. Telescopes are devices for\n        observing distant objects. The very first working telescope was\n        created in 1608 by the Dutch optician Hans Lippersgei. The\n        creation of the telescope was also attributed to such masters as\n        another Dutch eyeglass maker from Middelburg, Zachary Janssen,\n        and Jacob Mathews from the city of Alkmaar. These earliest\n        telescopes consisted of a convex lens as an objective and a\n        concave lens that served as an eyepiece. In 1609, Galileo\n        Galilei significantly improved the design of the telescope,\n        achieving a 30-fold increase in the original images. With its\n        help, Galileo performed the first survey of the heavenly bodies.\n        Therefore, even now, the creation of astronomical instruments,\n        whose characteristics significantly improve previous examples of\n        telescope construction, is considered extremely important in\n        astronomical research. The Hubble telescope was the first to\n        provide interesting information about the features of images of\n        the most distant galaxies. They are significantly different from\n        those formed relatively recently. One of the world\'s largest\n        ground-based telescopes, the Giant Magellan Telescope, is under\n        construction. It is being built in Chile and its gradual\n        commissioning will begin in 2024. Segments of seven monolithic\n        mirrors, with a diameter of 8.4 m each, create an optical\n        surface with an equivalent diameter of 24.5 m. Larger will be\n        the 30-meter telescope, which is planned to be built on the\n        island of Hawaii, next to the two 9-meter Keck reflectors at the\n        Mauna Kea observatory. The mirror surface of this telescope will\n        consist of almost five hundred hexagonal segments and will reach\n        a diameter of 30 m. It is expected to be tested in 2027. In\n        2014, the European Southern Observatory started the construction\n        of the Extremely Large Telescope. In 2025, it is planned to\n        become the most powerful optical astronomical instrument in the\n        world, with an equivalent diameter of its mirror surface of 39\n        m.}",\n       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024asal.book..204V},\n      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n\n@PROCEEDINGS{2018scrp.conf.....K,\n        title = "{Science and Computing with Raspberry Pi}",\n     keywords = {single board computing, astronomy, very large array, astrophysics, visualization, data science, computing, radio astronomy},\n    booktitle = {Science and Computing with Raspberry Pi},\n         year = 2018,\n        month = jul,\n    publisher = {Morgan & Claypool},\n     abstract = "{The portable Raspberry Pi computing platform with the power of Linux\n        yields an exciting exploratory tool for beginning scientific\n        computing.
