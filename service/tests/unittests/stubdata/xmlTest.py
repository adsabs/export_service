<dc:description>This paper describes a microwave free-space method using flat artificial
lens antennas with anti-reflection layer. The lens antenna is made of an
artificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous
study, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this
study to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved
lens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens
is applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch
antenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is
used to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust
sample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in
the free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens
interface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and
very small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and
low cost free-space setup using the improved lens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The outlined regions mark the 57 knots in Tycho selected by the authors
for velocity measurements. Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight
velocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-
of-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho
supernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years
later, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build
the first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of
ExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the
ejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the
surrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is
that they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is
this because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar
medium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can
explore this question is with detailed observations of the
remnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the
X (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the
observer). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.
[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led
by Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard
SFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho
supernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by
the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was
destabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of
expansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly
circular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the
supernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of
the shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams
and collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread
out around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray
observations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the
sky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then
combined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D
hydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These
show that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)
ejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the
morphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.
2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots
have total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the
forward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in
their motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The
more likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar
medium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant
without yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final
exploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos
clumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer
edge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,
or if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and
collaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to
simulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at
this time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an
important step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.
The authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the
future with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new
data from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter
emission.CitationBrian J. Williams et al 2017 ApJ 842 28.

<dc:description>We present a investigation into possible overlaps between the known IR
blobs with the grism aperture reference positions and the IR dither
patterns. Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a
specific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.
Similarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic
defects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known
defects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined
apertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it
is important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential
overlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not
recommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references
positions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the
overlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used
for high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field
surveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that
has a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very
conservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be
repeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for
high-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document
the analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-
phase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the
metallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control
sample of HI-'normal' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a
galaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /
{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity
profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are
found in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a
previous indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich
galaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some
indication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By
applying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the
variety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The
success of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated
galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.
This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-
metallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-
phase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)
observations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling
approach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of
emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and
spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular
emission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to
synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby
galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the
model to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our
testing we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central
metallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the
model and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes
approximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-
spread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming
clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity
gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we
emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved
observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved
galaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94
star-forming galaxies between (0.08 \\u3008 z \\u3008 0.84). We find a
negative median metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},
dex/kpc)/span\\u3009, i.e. on average we find the centres of these
galaxies to be more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is
significant scatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies
have significantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have
significantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent
with being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have
unreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more
negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and
increasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential
redshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to
be significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies
relative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the
metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to
other recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,
however, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a
galaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d \\u3008 3 kpc)) present a large
spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive
gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d \\u3009 3 kpc)
with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter
in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that
these large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the
present-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity
gradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy's stellar mass and
its gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between
star formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of
metals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is
therefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-
metallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar
mass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72
galaxies spanning (0.13 \\u3008 z \\u3008 0.84) with reliable metallicity
gradient estimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below
the mean mass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity
gradients. We quantify their relationship taking full account of the
covariance between the different variables and find that at fixed mass
the central metallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity
gradient. We argue that this is consistent with a scenario that
suppresses the central metallicity either through the inflow of metal
poor gas or outflow of metal enriched gas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The observing campaign from 2016 on V694 Mon (MWC 560) (AAVSO Alert
Notice 538) has been continued, but with different requirements.
Photometry is no longer specifically requested on a regular basis
(although ongoing observations that do not interfere with other
obligations are welcome). Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is
requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian
Lucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)
have requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line
symbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-
wavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,
#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study
the relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a
high-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be
extraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict
higher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity
also appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,
187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it
may prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow
origin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.
ATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this
system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, 'amateur'
spectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December
demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month
before an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000
km/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the
outflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any
resolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a
blueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest
wavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms
is ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.
Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary
to medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."
"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database
(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to
Adrian and Jeno directly at \\u3008lucy@astro.columbia.edu\\u3009. Finder
charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star
Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Photometry should be submitted to

<dc:description>ULIRG F01004-2237 had a strong optical flare, peaked in 2010, and the
follow-up optical spectra classified this event as a TDE candidate
(Tadhunter et al. 2017, Nature Astronomy). In early 2017, using archival
WISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been
steadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6
respectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that
F01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the
mid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a
convex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.
Our model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs
should start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already
reprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.
However, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs
could last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2
hours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12
months. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of
this transient event.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint
project between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed
at establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable
network of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing
structure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna
located in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in
telecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana
antenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to
observe at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a
required performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a
radio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication
antenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is
influenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural
deformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research
investigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing
accuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to
its structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and
thermal loads.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The discovery of the physical phenomenon of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) in 1946 gave rise to the spectroscopic technique that has become a
remarkably versatile research tool. One could oversimplify NMR spectros-
copy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure
elucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and
imaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR
spectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and
utilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to
present an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy
applications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses
of NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic
resonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.
Included here are summaries of projects involving protein structure
determination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring
fundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the
environmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging
of a model organism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Palomar-QUEST (PQ) synoptic sky survey has now been routinely processing
data from driftscans in real-time. As four photometric bandpasses are
utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for
transient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software
filters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain
criteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged
candidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,
known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects
based on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.
Some software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge
effects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.
During a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect
hundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for
astrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some
statistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the
objects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness
of this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other
synoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have
started on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as
various classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ
scans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual
Observatory environment. The PQ survey is partially supported by the
U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory's Synthesis Telescope
provides the highest resolution data (1 arcmin and 0.82 km/s) to date of
an HI worm candidate. Observed as part of the Canadian Galactic Plane
Survey, mushroom-shaped GW 123.4-1.5 extends only a few hundred parsecs,
contains ~10^5 solar masses of neutral hydrogen, and appears unrelated
to a conventional shell or chimney structure. Our preliminary Zeus-2d
models use a single off-plane explosion with a modest (~10^{51} ergs)
energy input. These generic simulations generate, interior to an
expanding outer blast wave, a buoyant cloud whose structure resembles
the morphology of the observed feature. Unlike typical model
superbubbles, the stem can be narrow because its width is not governed
by the pressure behind the blast wave nor the disk scale height. Using
this type of approach it should be possible to more accurately model the
thin stem and other details of GW 123.4-1.5 in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Spacecraft operation depends upon knowledge of vehicular position and,
consequently, navigational support has been required for all such
systems. Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and
orbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs
which may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are
considered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance
(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,
but are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as
weight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and
ground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for
spacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational
spacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational
centers with little or no navigational function allocated to the
vehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to
be directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military
significance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft
survivability and performance (accuracy).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The concept of using lunar beacon signal transmission for on-board
navigation for earth satellites and near-earth spacecraft is described.
The system would require powerful transmitters on the earth-side of the
moon's surface and black box receivers with antennae and microprocessors
placed on board spacecraft for autonomous navigation. Spacecraft
navigation requires three position and three velocity elements to
establish location coordinates. Two beacons could be soft-landed on the
lunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would
transmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be
strong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The
black box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way
Doppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites
such as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric
techniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation.</dc:description>

<abstract>This paper describes a microwave free-space method using flat artificial
lens antennas with anti-reflection layer. The lens antenna is made of an
artificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous
study, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this
study to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved
lens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens
is applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch
antenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is
used to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust
sample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in
the free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens
interface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and
very small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and
low cost free-space setup using the improved lens.</abstract>

<abstract>The outlined regions mark the 57 knots in Tycho selected by the authors
for velocity measurements. Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight
velocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-
of-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho
supernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years
later, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build
the first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of
ExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the
ejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the
surrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is
that they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is
this because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar
medium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can
explore this question is with detailed observations of the
remnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the
X (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the
observer). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.
[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led
by Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard
SFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho
supernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by
the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was
destabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of
expansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly
circular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the
supernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of
the shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams
and collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread
out around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray
observations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the
sky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then
combined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D
hydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These
show that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)
ejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the
morphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.
2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots
have total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the
forward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in
their motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The
more likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar
medium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant
without yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final
exploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos
clumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer
edge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,
or if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and
collaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to
simulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at
this time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an
important step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.
The authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the
future with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new
data from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter
emission.CitationBrian J. Williams et al 2017 ApJ 842 28.

<abstract>We present a investigation into possible overlaps between the known IR
blobs with the grism aperture reference positions and the IR dither
patterns. Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a
specific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.
Similarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic
defects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known
defects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined
apertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it
is important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential
overlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not
recommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references
positions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the
overlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used
for high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field
surveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that
has a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very
conservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be
repeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for
high-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document
the analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.</abstract>

<abstract>sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.
Phenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,
instrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously
inferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest. This package
relies on emcee (ascl:1303.002); it is best suited for situations where
a grid of model spectra already exists, and one would like to infer
model parameters given some data.</abstract>

<abstract>Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-
phase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the
metallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control
sample of HI-'normal' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a
galaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /
{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity
profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are
found in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a
previous indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich
galaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some
indication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By
applying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the
variety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The
success of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated
galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.
This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-
metallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-
phase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)
observations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling
approach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of
emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and
spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular
emission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to
synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby
galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the
model to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our
testing we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central
metallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the
model and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes
approximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-
spread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming
clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity
gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we
emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved
observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved
galaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94
star-forming galaxies between (0.08 \\u3008 z \\u3008 0.84). We find a
negative median metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},
dex/kpc)/span\\u3009, i.e. on average we find the centres of these
galaxies to be more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is
significant scatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies
have significantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have
significantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent
with being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have
unreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more
negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and
increasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential
redshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to
be significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies
relative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the
metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to
other recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,
however, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a
galaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d \\u3008 3 kpc)) present a large
spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive
gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d \\u3009 3 kpc)
with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter
in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that
these large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the
present-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity
gradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy's stellar mass and
its gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between
star formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of
metals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is
therefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-
metallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar
mass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72
galaxies spanning (0.13 \\u3008 z \\u3008 0.84) with reliable metallicity
gradient estimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below
the mean mass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity
gradients. We quantify their relationship taking full account of the
covariance between the different variables and find that at fixed mass
the central metallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity
gradient. We argue that this is consistent with a scenario that
suppresses the central metallicity either through the inflow of metal
poor gas or outflow of metal enriched gas.</abstract>

<abstract>The observing campaign from 2016 on V694 Mon (MWC 560) (AAVSO Alert
Notice 538) has been continued, but with different requirements.
Photometry is no longer specifically requested on a regular basis
(although ongoing observations that do not interfere with other
obligations are welcome). Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is
requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian
Lucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)
have requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line
symbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-
wavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,
#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study
the relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a
high-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be
extraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict
higher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity
also appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,
187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it
may prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow
origin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.
ATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this
system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, 'amateur'
spectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December
demonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month
before an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000
km/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the
outflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any
resolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a
blueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest
wavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms
is ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.
Photometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary
to medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."
"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database
(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to
Adrian and Jeno directly at \\u3008lucy@astro.columbia.edu\\u3009. Finder
charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star
Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Photometry should be submitted to
the AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more
details.</abstract>

<abstract>ULIRG F01004-2237 had a strong optical flare, peaked in 2010, and the
follow-up optical spectra classified this event as a TDE candidate
(Tadhunter et al. 2017, Nature Astronomy). In early 2017, using archival
WISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been
steadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6
respectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that
F01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the
mid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a
convex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.
Our model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs
should start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already
reprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.
However, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs
could last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2
hours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12
months. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of
this transient event.</abstract>

<abstract>The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint
project between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed
at establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable
network of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing
structure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna
located in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in
telecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana
antenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to
observe at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a
required performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a
radio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication
antenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is
influenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural
deformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research
investigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing
accuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to
its structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and
thermal loads.</abstract>

<abstract>The discovery of the physical phenomenon of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) in 1946 gave rise to the spectroscopic technique that has become a
remarkably versatile research tool. One could oversimplify NMR spectros-
copy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure
elucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and
imaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR
spectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and
utilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to
present an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy
applications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses
of NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic
resonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.
Included here are summaries of projects involving protein structure
determination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring
fundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the
environmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging
of a model organism.</abstract>

<abstract>Palomar-QUEST (PQ) synoptic sky survey has now been routinely processing
data from driftscans in real-time. As four photometric bandpasses are
utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for
transient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software
filters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain
criteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged
candidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,
known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects
based on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.
Some software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge
effects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.
During a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect
hundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for
astrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some
statistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the
objects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness
of this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other
synoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have
started on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as
various classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ
scans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual
Observatory environment. The PQ survey is partially supported by the
U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).</abstract>

<abstract>The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory's Synthesis Telescope
provides the highest resolution data (1 arcmin and 0.82 km/s) to date of
an HI worm candidate. Observed as part of the Canadian Galactic Plane
Survey, mushroom-shaped GW 123.4-1.5 extends only a few hundred parsecs,
contains ~10^5 solar masses of neutral hydrogen, and appears unrelated
to a conventional shell or chimney structure. Our preliminary Zeus-2d
models use a single off-plane explosion with a modest (~10^{51} ergs)
energy input. These generic simulations generate, interior to an
expanding outer blast wave, a buoyant cloud whose structure resembles
the morphology of the observed feature. Unlike typical model
superbubbles, the stem can be narrow because its width is not governed
by the pressure behind the blast wave nor the disk scale height. Using
this type of approach it should be possible to more accurately model the
thin stem and other details of GW 123.4-1.5 in the future.</abstract>

<abstract>Spacecraft operation depends upon knowledge of vehicular position and,
consequently, navigational support has been required for all such
systems. Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and
orbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs
which may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are
considered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance
(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,
but are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as
weight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and
ground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for
spacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational
spacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational
centers with little or no navigational function allocated to the
vehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to
be directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military
significance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft
survivability and performance (accuracy).</abstract>

<abstract>The concept of using lunar beacon signal transmission for on-board
navigation for earth satellites and near-earth spacecraft is described.
The system would require powerful transmitters on the earth-side of the
moon's surface and black box receivers with antennae and microprocessors
placed on board spacecraft for autonomous navigation. Spacecraft
navigation requires three position and three velocity elements to
establish location coordinates. Two beacons could be soft-landed on the
lunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would
transmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be
strong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The
black box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way
Doppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites
such as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric
techniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation.</abstract>
